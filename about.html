                   Yvette Taminiau (b. 1965)<br> is a Dutch artist, as well as an associate professor at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, the Netherlands. <br>In her work, she balances and mixes both worlds. Taminiau’s newsprint paintings comprise a dialogue between the artist and the page. She transforms newspaper pages in an associative manner, responding to the images, headlines, articles, and the layout of the page. Her approach is intuitive and suggestive&nbsp;—&nbsp;while her academic background, with its strong reliance on analytical frameworks, is reflected in her selection of topics and articles from the newspapers. Dutch, French, and English news acts as her referential canvas, from economic issues to political coverage to cultural icons. <br><br>Furthermore she works on a smaller scale drawing on postcards and on a bigger scale with charcoal on big sheets of paper hung up on the wall.
